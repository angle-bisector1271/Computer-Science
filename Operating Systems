What is an operating system?
ANS>>A software to manage a computer's resources.
What specifically does it manage?
ANS>>CPU,memory,file system,I/O devices
What does it mean for a CPU to FETCH an instruction from memory and what does it mean to decode that instruction?
What is an instruction set architecture?
3>>What are the 2 fundamental models of computation?
ANS>>Von Neumann model (Instructions and data are stored on the same memory, instructions are executed sequentially)
4>>What are different kinds of operating systems?
ANS>>Unix, non-unix, embedded system, etc
5>>What is a kernel?
ANS>>Part of the OS that interacts directly with the hardware.
6>>What is a program and what is a process?
ANS>>A program is a set of instructions and a proces is a program that is currently being executed.
7>>What is the machine state of a process?
ANS>>The complete set of information needed by the CPU for execution of a program at any point of time.
8>>What is address space?
ANS>>The entire range of memory addresses available for use by a program. Or the virtual map of memory.
9>>What is the difference between stack and heap?
ANS>> Stack stores function calls and local variables, heap stores dynamically allocated memory.
ANS>> Stack has automatic memory allocation, heap has dynamic memory allocation, which is programmer-controlled.
ANS>> Stack is automatically freed after the process ends, but heap has to be freed manually.
10>>What is fragmentation and what is memory leak?
ANS>>Fragmentation occurs when memory allocation for a process is not possible despite total memory availability being sufficient,
ANS>>because of memory previously having been allocated in non-contiguous chunks, which leads to unavailability of a new
ANS>>contiguous chunk of memory for allocation to a process.
ANS>>A memory leak happens when a programmer allocates memory dynamically but never frees it.
11>What happens when a CPU starts executing a process?
ANS>>First, memory is allocated, then the instruction and initialized variables are loaded. Then basic files like cin,cout are opened.
ANS>>Then CPU registers are initialized.
12>>What are different states of a process?
ANS>>Running,Ready,Blocked,New,Dead. Blocked process is a currently suspended process that is waiting for some signal or interrupt to get ready.
ANS>>A ready process is waiting for it to get scheduled when a CPU becomes free.
ANS>>When a ready process gets scheduled it becomes a running process.
What is an interrupt?
ANS>>A signal from hardware or software to CPU that indicates the occurance of an event that needs immediate attention.
ANS>>It causes the CPU to temporarily halt doing what it is doing and attend to the event using its interrupt handler.
What is the difference bbetween a policy and a mechanism?
What are the data structures that an OS needs to track processes?
ANS>>Process List and Process Control Block
What is an API?
What is a system call? What is a system API?
In UNIX what are the 3 main process related system calls and what does each one of them do?
What does Fork return?
What does it mean to reap zombies?
Who is the daddy of all processes?
ANS>>init process.
What is a file descriptor and what is piping?
What is a function call?
What is a trap?
Whta is a context swiitch?
What is a trap table?

13>>What is Page table and MMU?
ANS>>
14>>What is the difference between new and malloc?
ANS>>
15>>What is a segmentation fault?
ANS>>Illegal Memory Access attempt
16>>What is the difference between a system call and a library call?
ANS>>>
17>>In the segmentationn approach, what does OS do during conntext switch?
ANS>>
18>>What is fragmentation and how to manage it?
19>>What is slab allocator and what is buddy allocator?
20>>What is free list and what is free block?
21>>Concurrency vs parallelism 
Race condition
Deadlock
Time sharing
Switching context
Policy vs Mechanism
Process list and process control block 
API, System API
System call
fork, exec, wait
Zombie process, reap


CPU Scheduling, Turnaround time
